        <p>
          Brownies welcomes all girls from 7 to 10 years old for nonstop fun, learning, and adventure. It’s full of firsts: she might grow her first plant, cook her first cake, put up (and take down) her first tent, light her first fire, or go on her first fun-packed weekend away with guiding friends.
